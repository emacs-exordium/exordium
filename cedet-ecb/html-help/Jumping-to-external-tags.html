<h4 class="subsection">6.6.6 Jumping to the definition of external types</h4>

<p>There are two common types of &ldquo;external&rdquo; tags displayed in the
method-window, mostly with object oriented programing-languages:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>parent-types

     <p>Tags which represent the type of a parent-class (which can be defined in the
same file but which is more often defined in another file). All parents
(regardless if defined internaly or externaly) of a type will be displayed
under a bucket &ldquo;[Parents]&rdquo; in the methods-window of ECB.

     <li>&ldquo;virtual&rdquo; types

     <p>In OO-languages like CLOS, eieio and C++ there can be nodes with type-tags in
the method-buffer which are somehow virtual because there is no definition in
the current source-file. But such a virtual type collects all its outside
defined members like methods in C++ which are defined in the <samp><span class="file">*.cc</span></samp> file
whereas the class-definition is defined in the associated header-file.

        </ol>

   <p>In both cases the user wants to jump to the definition of the type if he clicks
onto the related node in the methods-window of ECB.

   <p>Here is a C++-example for &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; types (2) and parent types (1) which
explains this in detail:

   <p>Let's say this class is defined in a file <samp><span class="file">ParentClass.h</span></samp>:

<pre class="example">   class ParentClass
   {
   protected:
     int p;
   };
</pre>
   <p>Let's say this class is defined in a file <samp><span class="file">ClassWithExternals.h</span></samp>

<pre class="example">   #include "ParentClass.h"
   
   class ClassWithExternals : public ParentClass
   {
   private:
     int i;
   
   public:
     ClassWithExternals();
     ~ClassWithExternals();
   };
</pre>
   <p>Both the constructor and the destructor of the class
&ldquo;ClassWithExternals&rdquo; are implemented in a file
<samp><span class="file">ClassWithExternals.cc</span></samp>:

<pre class="example">   #include "test.h"
   
   ClassWithExternals::ClassWithExternals(int i,
                                          boolean b,
                                          char c)
   {
     return;
   }
   
   void
   ClassWithExternals::~ClassWithExternals()
   {
     return;
   }
</pre>
   <p>ECB displays the contents of <samp><span class="file">ClassWithExternals.cc</span></samp> in its methods-buffer like
follows:

<pre class="example">   [-] [Includes]
    `- test.h
   [-] ClassWithExternals
    |  +ClassWithExternals (+i:int, +b:class boolean, +c:char):ClassWithExternals
    `- +~ClassWithExternals ():void
</pre>
   <p>Both the constructor and the destructor of the class
&ldquo;ClassWithExternals&rdquo; are grouped under their class-type. But this class-type
&ldquo;ClassWithExternals&rdquo; is represented by a so called &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; or &ldquo;faux&rdquo;
node-tag, i.e. there is no real tag in the current source-buffer for this tag.

   <p>If a user now clicks onto the node of &ldquo;ClassWithExternals&rdquo; then he wants to
jump to the right location in the right file where &ldquo;ClassWithExternals&rdquo; is
defined. ECB now uses now some smart mechanisms (see below) to do this. In
case of success (means ECB has found the definition) it opens the right file
and point will stay at beginning of the definition of the type
&ldquo;ClassWithExternals&rdquo;.

   <p>The contents of <samp><span class="file">ClassWithExternals.h</span></samp> are then displayed like
follows:

<pre class="example">   [-] [Includes]
    `- ParentClass.h
   [-] ClassWithExternals:class
    |  [-] [Parents]
    |   `- ParentClass
    |  [-] [Variables]
    |   `- -i:int
    |  +ClassWithExternals ():ClassWithExternals
    |  +~ClassWithExternals ():void
    `- [+] [Misc]
</pre>
   <p>Now let's play it again: Now we want to go to the definition of the
parent-type &ldquo;ParentClass&rdquo; when we click onto the related node under the
bucket &ldquo;[Parents]&rdquo;. Again ECB uses its smartness to jump to the definition
of the class &ldquo;ParentClass&rdquo; when you click onto the node &ldquo;ParentClass&rdquo;.

   <p>Now lets explain the precondition which must be fulfilled so ECB can do its
job:

     <ul>
<li>Customizing the semantic analyzer for your needs

     <p>ECB itself is quite stupid concerning finding external tags. But it can use
the semantic-analyzer of the CEDET-suite (remember: The CEDET-suite is a
must-requirement of ECB, see <a href="Requirements.html#Requirements">Requirements</a>). But this in turn means that the
semantic-analyzer must be customized in the right way for the needs of your
programing projects. Mainly this means activating semanticdb and setting the
correct include-path etc...

     <p><strong>Please note</strong>: Read the related manuals of semantic and - strongly
recommended - read in addition the article &ldquo;Gentle introduction to Cedet&rdquo;. 
It's worth to read it! The website of CEDET contains a link, you find it here:
<a href="http://xtalk.msk.su/~ott/en/writings/emacs-devenv/EmacsCedet.html">http://xtalk.msk.su/~ott/en/writings/emacs-devenv/EmacsCedet.html</a>

     <li>Customize the related options of ECB:

     <p>There is exactly one option you have to take into account:
<code>ecb-find-external-tag-functions</code>. This defines the method ECB uses to
find these external tags.

     <p>Mostly there is nothing to do because the default values should do a good job. 
But if things are running bad then maybe this is the right screw for you.

     <p>Finding such external types can be very complex and there are several roads to
success. ECB uses per default methods based on the semantic-analyzer. But this
option allows to define own find-functions and tell ECB to uses them.

     <p>This functionality is set on a major-mode base, i.e. for every major-mode a
different setting can be used. ECB first performs all find-functions defined
for current major-mode (if any) anf then all find-functions defined for the
special symbol 'default (if any).

     <p>ECB offers some predefined senseful finding-functions. Currently there are:

          <ul>
<li><code>ecb-search-type-tag-by-semantic-analyzer</code>: The most powerfil one, based
on the semantic-analyzer
<li><code>ecb-search-type-tag-by-semanticdb</code>: A backup for the first one
<li><code>ecb-jde-show-class-source</code>: For major-mode <code>jde-mode</code> when
coding in java, uses java-mechanisms - maybe for java the best choice. 
</ul>

     <p>See the documentation of the option and also of these function for details how
they work and how to write own finding-functions.

   </ul>
