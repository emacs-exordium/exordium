COGRE: COnnected GRaph Editor
*****************************

COGRE is a package that enables Emacs to display connected graph
diagrams in a text buffer.  The main goal is to provide UML class
diagrams, but any kind of graph can be supported through object
inheritance via EIEIO *Note (eieio)Top::.

   Warning: Very little in this manual has been written.

1 Getting Started
*****************

There are three basic parts to any COGRE interface.

  1. Graph The graph consists of a buffer, and all child elements in
     that graph.  The graph is treated as any other Emacs buffer.  When
     that buffer is selected, Graph editing commands are available.

  2. Node A Node consists of a square region of screen space, and
     usually a name.  Nodes can be anything, but common examples are
     Classes, Packages, or other "object like" things.

  3. Link A Link is a line that connects two nodes.  A link may not
     exist without a node at both ends.  When a node is deleted, all
     links connected to it in some way are also deleted.

   The first step to using COGRE is to create a new graph.  Once you
have a graph, you can create nodes and links.

   You can create a new graph with the `cogre' command, or open a new
file that ends with the `.cgr' extension.

   Use normal keybindings such as `C-x C-s' to save your graph into a
file.  Use a `.cgr' extension so Emacs can correctly parse the file
into a graph again later.

 -- Function: cogre name &optional graph-class
     Create a new graph not associated with a buffer.  The new graph
     will be given NAME.  See "cogre-mode" for details.  Optional
     argument GRAPH-CLASS indicates the type of graph to create.

1.1 Creating Nodes and Links
============================

The easiest way to create a node is with the insert popup menu.  Right
click anywhere in the graph where there is no pre-existing node or
link, and a menu will appear allowing you to select the node style you
want.

   Nodes are created with the command `cogre-new-node', which is also
bound to `N' in the graph.

 -- Command: cogre-new-node point nodetype
     Insert a new node at the current point.  Argument POINT is a
     position to insert this node to.  NODETYPE is the eieio class name
     for the node to insert.

   The easiest way to create a link is with a `mouse-2' drag operation.
Click the middle mouse button on a node, and drag the cursor to a
second node.  A popup menu will appear where the link type can be
selected.  The new link will be created connecting the two nodes.

   New links can also be created with the command `cogre-new-link'
which is bound to `L'.

 -- Command: cogre-new-link mark point &optional linktype
     Insert a new link from the node at MARK to POINT of LINKTYPE.
     MARK is the node within which the current mark is set.  POINT is
     the node the cursor is in.  LINKTYPE is the EIEIO class name for
     the link to insert.

   To configure the default type of node to insert via the keyboard,
such as a UML class node, use `cogre-default-node'.  Likewise, use
`cogre-default-link'.  These are bound to `C-c C-n', and `C-c C-l'
respectively.

 -- Command: cogre-default-node &optional node prefix
     Return the default node type.  If run interactively, query for a
     new node to make the default.  If called non-interactivly there is
     no default, query for one.  If NODE is supplied, use that.  If
     there is a PREFIX argument, then force a query for one.

 -- Command: cogre-default-link &optional link prefix
     Return the default link type.  If run interactively, query for a
     new link to make the default.  If called non-interactivly there is
     no default, query for one.  If LINK is supplied, use that.  If
     there is a PREFIX argument, then force a query for one.

1.2 Moving Nodes
================

Moving nodes around is also how to move links around.  As a node moves,
the links will re-route.  Movement is done with the mouse, or with meta
key bindings.

   To use the mouse, click with the left mouse button (`mouse-1') and
drag the node to a new location.

`M-b'
`meta left'
     Move a node left one character

`M-f'
`meta right'
     Move a node right one character

`M-n'
`meta down'
     Move a node down one character

`M-p'
`meta up'
     Move a node up one character

`TAB'
     Move point to the next node

`M-TAB'
     Move point to the previous node

   Sometimes the movement via keyboard of nodes will cause other nodes
to get their graphic to be partially erased.  Minimal steps are taken to
refresh the graph to keep things fast in large drawings.  To fix the
problem, use the `R' keybinding to redraw the entire graph from scratch.

1.3 Customizing Nodes
=====================

Nodes and links are EIEIO objects, and can be customized.  Press `RET'
on a node or link to customize the slots of that object.

3 Export
********

COGRE can export your graph into different formats.  The simplest
format is into an all ASCII diagram:

 -- Function: cogre-export-ascii
     Export the current diagram into an ASCII buffer.

   Other formats are supported through the configuration of Graphviz
tools.  You will need to install and configure Graphviz to use these
features.  The CEDET variables controlling how dot and neato are called
are:

 -- Function: cedet-graphviz-dot-command
     Command name for the Graphviz DOT executable.

 -- Function: cedet-graphviz-neato-command
     Command name for the Graphviz NEATO executable.

   Also, when converting to and from DOT formatted files, a scaling
factor needs to be applied as the DOT coordinates (in points) are
converted into character sized units for COGRE.

 -- Function: cogre-dot-node-position-scale
     The scale to use when converting between COGRE and DOT position
     values.  This is of the format ( XSCALE . YSCALE ).  DOT uses
     points, where as COGRE uses characters.

   Here are some handy exporting commands.

 -- Function: cogre-export-dot
     Export the current COGRE graph to DOT notation.  DOT is a part of
     GraphViz.

 -- Function: cogre-export-dot-png
     Export the current COGRE graph to DOT, then convert that to PNG.
     The png file is then displayed in an Emacs buffer.  DOT is a part
     of GraphVis.

 -- Function: cogre-export-dot-postscript-print
     Print the current graph.  This is done by exporting the current
     COGRE graph to DOT, then convert that to Postscript before
     printing.  DOT is a part of GraphVis.
