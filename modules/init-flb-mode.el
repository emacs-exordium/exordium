;;; init-flb-mode.el --- Minor mode for making buffers local to each frame -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This mode adds the notion of buffer ownership to Emacs frames.  If you use
;; many frames (for example with emacsclient), each frame will show a reduced
;; list of buffers - the ones that you opened in that frame - instead of all
;; buffers.
;;
;; M-x `flb-mode' toggles the frame-local-buffers mode.  When this mode is on,
;; any function for selecting buffers such as `C-x b' will only show the
;; buffers that have been open within that frame.  In addition, closing a frame
;; automatically closes all buffers that were only open within that frame.
;;
;; Usage example:
;; 1. Open foo.txt
;; 2. Turn on `flb-mode'
;; 3. Open a new frame with `C-x 5 2', which will also display foo.txt
;; 4. Open bar.txt in the second frame
;; 5. Do `C-x b' in both frames: foo.txt will show up in both, but bar.txt
;;    will only appear in the second frame.
;; 6. Close the second frame: bar.txt is automatically closed.  You can verify
;;    that by disabling flb-mode (to show all buffers).
;;
;; Note: if multiple frames are open when flb-mode is turned on, all these
;; frames share all existing buffers, meaning they show in each frame's buffer
;; list.  Also note that this mode only deals with buffer visibility: killing a
;; buffer kills it for all frames.
;;
;; Implementation: flb-mode uses a variable that associates a list of buffers
;; to each frame.  When the mode is enabled it replaces the definition of
;; function `buffer-list' by its own function, so that any function that uses
;; `buffer-list' (such as IDO) will work correctly.  The `flb-mode' also adds a
;; hook that is executed after each command: it is used to detect if new frames
;; or buffers are open or killed in order to maintain the variable.  The hook
;; has a very small cost.
