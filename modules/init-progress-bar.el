;;;; Progress bar.
;;;
;;; This module provides a function `update-progress-bar' which display the
;;; progress of init.el. This function is supposed to be called at various
;;; intervals of init.el. Constant `exordium-loading-step-count' must be set to
;;; the number of steps, e.g. the number of times `update-progress-bar' will be
;;; called.
;;;
;;; This idea was shamelessly borrowed from Spacemacs.
;;;
;;; Note: this is just for fun. It actually makes the configuration load slower.

;;; Set this constant to the number of times `update-progress-bar' is called in
;;; init.el:
