;; C-c <arrow>       Move cursor between windows (similar to C-x o).
;; C-c shift-<arrow> Move the windows themselves, e.g. swap them.
;; M-p <number>      Ace-window: M-p displays a number in each window, and you
;;                   just have to type the number you want.  If there are only
;;                   2 windows, it cycles between them.
;;
;; Simple test:
;; - C-x 2           split the screen between 2 windows one on top of the other
;; - M-C-l           open a different buffer in the current window
;; - C-c up/down     jump between windows
;; - C-c S-up/down   swap windows
;;
;; Functions:
;;
;; `exordium-toggle-window-dedicated' makes a window dedicated or not (it prevents
;; Emacs from reusing the window to display another buffer).
